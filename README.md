## Overview

### SKU:M144

**Module Audio** is an M5Stack expansion module designed for audio interaction, based on the ES8388 audio codec solution, supporting dual ADC inputs and dual DAC outputs. Equipped with an STM32G030F6P6 microcontroller to enable microphone GPIO software control, detect insertion/removal on the TRRS jack, and drive WS2812C RGB lighting effects. Onboard is a 3.5 mm TRS jack dedicated solely to microphone input, and a 3.5 mm TRRS jack that supports both microphone input and headphone playback. Through register configuration, it can automatically switch between CTIA (American standard) and OMTP (Chinese standard) wiring standards, compatible with mainstream headsets with microphones. The module uses the M5-BUS interface, requiring no additional wiring to seamlessly stack with the M5Stack Core host. This product is suitable for intelligent voice applications, interactive art, educational entertainment, portable recording, and various other audio scenarios.
