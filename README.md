### SKU:M144

**Module Audio** is an M5Stack expansion module designed for audio interaction, based on the ES8388 audio codec solution, supporting dual ADC inputs and dual DAC outputs; and is equipped with an STM32G030F6P6 microcontroller to enable GPIO software control for the microphone, detect headphone insertion/removal on the TRRS jack, and drive WS2812C RGB lighting effects. It uses an FSUSB42MUX dual SPDT analog switch to automatically switch between CTIA (American standard) and OMTP (Chinese standard) wiring standards, making it compatible with mainstream headsets with microphones. The module is plug-and-play via the M5-BUS interface and seamlessly stacks with the M5Stack Core host. It is equipped with a 3.5 mm jack dedicated solely to microphone input, as well as a TRRS combo jack that supports both headphone playback and microphone input. This product is suitable for intelligent voice applications, interactive art, educational entertainment, portable recording, and various other audio use cases.
